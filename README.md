# Wine Quality Prediction using Logistic Regression and SVM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the quality of red wine using machine learning classification techniques.

The dataset contains physicochemical features like:
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- pH
- Alcohol
- Sulphates

The quality scores were converted into binary classification:
- Good Wine (1)
- Bad Wine (0)
